# NNTrainer_Python

<h3>A library for automatic supervised training of neural models.</h3>

<p>
  This library provides methods for training supervised neural network models without the need to implement all the necessary steps (eg. input handling, reformatting, batching, evaluation, feedback, etc.). It also allows for a large amount of customization in the training and evaluation process, while also making assumptions where possible, in order to minimize required user input.
